## Enhancing Code Representation With Additional Context

This repository contains the data and code for the journal paper "Enhancing Code Representation With Additional Context"

### Data 

Our data is published using Figshare, please download data from [here](https://figshare.com/s/71c3233d55c2ad91f30c) and put it into the folder data before running experiments.

## Structure
The structure of our source code's repository is as follows:
- Classification: contains our script experimenting Code Clone Detection and Code Classification Tasks;
- Summarization: contains our script experimenting Code Summarization Task;   
- env.yml: contains the configuration for our enviroment. 


### Replicating results in the Paper

To replicate our results, please follow the instruction as below:

- Code Clone Detection: Please use the folder `Classification/`

```
bash experiment_clone.sh
```

- Code Classification: Please use the folder `Classification/`

```
bash experiment_class.sh
```

- Code Summarisation: we can use the respective folder (e.g. `CodeBERT`, `GraphCodeBERT`, `CodeT5`, and `PLBART`) in the project directory at `Summarization/Task/Code-Summarization/`. For instance, to replicate `CodeT5`'s result, we use the following bash commands for different scenarios:

        - Without Context (baseline):

        ```
        $cd Summarization/Task/Code-Summarization/codet5
        $bash bash ./run_exp.sh java baseline
        ```
        - Code + Version History:
        
        ```
        $cd Summarization/Task/Code-Summarization/codet5
        $bash bash ./run_exp.sh java code_vh
        ```

        - Code + Call Graph:
        
        ```
        $cd Summarization/Task/Code-Summarization/codet5
        $bash bash ./run_exp.sh java code_cg
        ```

        - Code + Version History + Method Age:
        
        ```
        $cd Summarization/Task/Code-Summarization/codet5
        $bash bash ./run_exp.sh java code_vh_nod
        ```

        - Code + Version History + Call Graph:
        
        ```
        $cd Summarization/Task/Code-Summarization/codet5
        $bash bash ./run_exp.sh java code_vh_cg
        ```

        - Code + Call Graph + Version History:
        
        ```
        $cd Summarization/Task/Code-Summarization/codet5
        $bash bash ./run_exp.sh java code_cg_vh
        ```

        - Code + Version History + Call Graph + Method Age:
        
        ```
        $cd Summarization/Task/Code-Summarization/codet5
        $bash bash ./run_exp.sh java code_vh_cg_nod
        ```

        - Code + Call Graph + Version History + Method Age:
        
        ```
        $cd Summarization/Task/Code-Summarization/codet5
        $bash bash ./run_exp.sh java code_cg_vh_nod
        ```

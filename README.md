## Enhancing Code Representation With Additional Context

This repository contains the data and code for the journal paper "Enhancing Code Representation With Additional Context"

### Data 

Our data is published using Figshare, please download data from [here](https://figshare.com/s/71c3233d55c2ad91f30c) and put it into the folder data before running experiments.

## Structure
The structure of our source code's repository is as follows:
- Classification: contains our script experimenting Code Clone Detection and Code Classification Tasks;
- Summarization: contains our script experimenting Code Summarization Task;   
- env.yml: contains the configuration for our enviroment.
